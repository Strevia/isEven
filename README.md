If you've ever wanted to know whether a number is even, you've probably realized that it is not a simple, one-line solution.
Determining whether a number is even is specific to each number, and as such needs a hard-coded solution.
But hard coding is evil and always wrong! So what do we do?
With my premiere isEven implementation, you get the best of both worlds. Simply run `python main.py <number-to-check>` and, after determining whether the number is even, the program will add it to the list of hard-coded values. 
What's the performance you ask? Probably O(1) or O(n) or something. But it's the principle that counts.

Oh yeah and it only works on Linux sorry.
